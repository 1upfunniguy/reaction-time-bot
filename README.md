# reaction-time-bot
made for human benchmark and just park if their are any other websites feel free to edit the code you can use any color picker (i used aseprites) and detect that color, press ctrl f6 to start and stop this script!!!
(https://www.justpark.com/creative/reaction-time-test/ and https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime) also this has nothing to do with anything but i managed to get the "we think your a robot" message without the bot

then hover over the first small stop sign
